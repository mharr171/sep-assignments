1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
7 iterations using linear search

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
4 iterations using binary search

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
n   | fib(n-2)  | fib(n-1)  | fib(n)
----|-----------|-----------|--------
10  | 21        | 34        | 55
11  | 34        | 55        | 89
12  | 55        | 89        | 144

4. Compare the time it takes to run fib(20) between the iterative solution from
the previous checkpoint and recursive solutions.
user     system      total        real
fib iterative  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000008)
fib recursive  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001480)

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or
recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
I would use linear search because binary search is not an option with an
unsorted collection.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or
recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
I would use binary search because of the large number of items. Going through
the collection iteratively would take significantly longer.
