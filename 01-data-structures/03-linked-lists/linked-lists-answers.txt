What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
Spatial locality refers to data that is stored within close storage locations.
Spatial locality benefits performance in arrays by storing data next to each
other resulting in quicker iteration of the data.

Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.

Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.
(time to create 10,000 item array) < (time to append 10,000 items to linked list)
Pushing 10,000 items to array
user       system     total    real
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.005014)
Appending 10,000 items to linked list
user       system     total    real
0.010000   0.000000   0.010000 (0.011136)

Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
(time to access 5,000th item array) < (time to access 5,000th node to linked list)
Find 5,000th item in array
user       system     total    real
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.000008)
Find 5,000th item in linked list
user       system     total    real
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.001000)

Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
(time to delete 5,000th item array) < (time to append 5,000th node to linked list)
Delete 5,000th item in array
user       system     total    real
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.000015)
Delete 5,000th item in list
user       system     total    real
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.002338)

Overall, the speed performance of arrays are faster than linked lists because of
spatial locality.
