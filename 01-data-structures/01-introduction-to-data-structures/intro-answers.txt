1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

Line
> Developers can use the join and leave functions to have people join and leave
the line with the person as a parameter. Having a person join the line puts them
at the back of the line. And to have the front/back of the line leave (making a
queue or stack) we can use the front and back functions within the leave
function as a parameter.
> There is a search function that takes a person as a parameter and returns
whether or not they are in the line.
> The data structure could represent a series of cans in a soda vending
machine. It could also represent a stack of books where they are laid on top of
each other.

Screen & Pixel
> Pixels are created using their values for Red, Green, and Blue along with
their x and y positions as parameters. A screen is created with the height and
width given as parameters. Pixels can be added to the screen using the pixel,
and its x and y positions on the screen as parameters.
> Pixels can be searched for using their x and y positions using the at
function.
> The screen could possibly represent a classroom's seating chart (5 x 5
possibly), with each student represented by a unique color. It could also
represent a checkerboard.
