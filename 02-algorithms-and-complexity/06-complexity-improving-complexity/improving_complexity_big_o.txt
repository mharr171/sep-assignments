Code Optimization
The code optimized version runs in O(n^2) time. As we are looping through the
combined_array and then looping through our sorted array to find its proper
position. At its worst it is looping through n items and again through (n-1)
items.

Time Optimization
The code was simply changed to a merge sort, changing our worst case scenario to
run in loglinear time or O(n log n).

Space Optimization
This code uses ruby's default array sort function which uses a quick sort method.
Quick sort runs in loglinear time or O(n log n) time.
